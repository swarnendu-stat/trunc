Title: Truncated Distribution (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Description: The goal of trunc is to provide facilitate generating random variate 
    values, distribution function, density function and quantile function for 
    uni-variate truncated distributions.
    The underlying distribution can be any distribution that is available in the 
    namespace. For example, gompertz distribution available means that the 
    corresponding rgompertz, dgompertz, pgompertz, qgompertz are available. 
    trunc utilizes these functions to provide their truncated counterpart.
